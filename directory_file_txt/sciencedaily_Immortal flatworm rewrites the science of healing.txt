Title: “Immortal” flatworm rewrites the science of healing

Summary: Flatworms can rebuild themselves from just a small fragment, and now scientists know why. Their stem cells ignore nearby instructions and respond to long-distance signals from other tissues. This discovery turns old stem cell theories upside down and could lead to new ways to repair or regrow human tissue. It also reveals a hidden complexity in one of nature’s simplest creatures.
