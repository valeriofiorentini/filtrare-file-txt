Title: Scientists shocked by reversed electric field around Earth

Summary: Earth’s magnetosphere, once thought to have a simple electric polarity pattern, has revealed a surprising twist. New satellite data and advanced simulations show that the morning side of the magnetosphere carries a negative charge, not positive as long believed. Researchers from Kyoto, Nagoya, and Kyushu Universities found that while the polar regions retain the expected polarity, the equatorial areas flip it entirely.
