Title: ‘It is the scariest of times’: Margaret Atwood on defying Trump, banned books – and her score-settling memoir

Summary: <p>At 86, she’s a literary seer and saint – and queen of the Canadian resistance. So what does the writer make of our dystopian world?</p><p>• ‘From (finally) being given the Booker prize to the day her partner died’: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/nov/01/margaret-atwood-memoir-extract-booker-prize-death-of-partner">an exclusive extract</a> from Margaret Atwood’s memoir</p><p>Margaret Atwood is doing her grocery shopping in her local supermarket in Toronto, and it&nbsp;is taking longer than usual. This is not because The&nbsp;Handmaid’s Tale author turns 86 this month, but because she is checking the provenance of every item before it goes in her trolley: California satsumas out; Canada spuds in. Atwood is a passionate environmentalist, but at the moment she is more worried about boycotting anything that comes from over the border in the US than air miles. “Elbows up!” she declares, taking a furious stance in the fruit and veg aisle.</p><p>Back in her kitchen she shows me a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=al9yWA4TUII">YouTube skit</a> of Canadian prime minister Mark Carney and comedian Mike Myers in the national hockey kit to explain the significance of “Elbows up”, a growing gesture of Canadian resistance. “Oh, they’re angry. They’re furious,” she says of the reaction to President Trump’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/06/trump-mark-carney-canada-meeting">proposed plans to make Canada the 51st state of America</a>. “We’ve not got a very big army. If they wanted to invade they could do so. But I don’t think they would. Do they have any idea what it would be like to try to occupy a hostile Canada? It would not be a joke.” Trump would have to deal with Atwood, for starters.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/nov/01/margaret-atwood-interview-handmaids-tale-author-new-memoir">Continue reading...</a>
