Title: Antarctic robot ‘Lassie’ uncovers thousands of icefish nests beneath Antarctic ice

Summary: Beneath the ice of Antarctica’s Weddell Sea, scientists discovered a vast, organized city of fish nests revealed after the colossal A68 iceberg broke away. Using robotic explorers, they found over a thousand circular nests forming geometric patterns, each guarded by yellowfin noties. The expedition, initially aimed at studying the ice shelf and locating Shackleton’s Endurance, instead unveiled a thriving, structured ecosystem in one of the harshest places on Earth.
