Title: Electricity reprograms immune cells to speed up recovery

Summary: By electrically stimulating macrophages, scientists at Trinity College Dublin have found a way to calm inflammation and promote faster healing. The process turns these immune cells into tissue-repairing helpers, enhancing regeneration and blood vessel growth. Safe, effective, and based on human cells, this discovery could revolutionize treatments for inflammation and injury recovery.
