Title: Crispy chicken and pancetta with a nutty apple salad: Thomasina Miers’ Sunday best recipes

Summary: <p>Crisp chicken and sweet onions with rosemary and salty pancetta, set off by a sweet-sour apple salad with pickled red onion and hazelnuts</p><p>I recently invested in a beautifully wide, Shropshire-made pan that works on the hob and in the oven with equal ease, and without the chemical nonstick lining I keep reading about. It is a brilliant pan. As I turn on the heat to crisp the skin on my chicken thighs on the stove top, I can prep the vegetables I will then roast in the same pan. There is a soothing rhythm to this type of cooking, where most of the work is done in the oven. Here, I use jerusalem artichokes, the most delicious of autumn vegetables, parboiled in lemon juice to make them more digestible and then roasted with garlic and onions, until beautifully caramelised, and it’s a marvellous thing to put down on the kitchen table.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/nov/01/crispy-chicken-pancetta-nutty-apple-salad-recipes-thomasina-miers">Continue reading...</a>
