Title: This tiny bat hunts like a lion, but better

Summary: Fringe-lipped bats from Panama hunt like miniature lions, using a “hang-and-wait” strategy to capture large, energy-rich prey. High-tech biologging revealed they spend most of their time conserving energy and strike with remarkable accuracy. With success rates around 50%, they outperform even apex predators like lions and polar bears. Older bats become even more efficient, showing that experience sharpens their deadly precision.
