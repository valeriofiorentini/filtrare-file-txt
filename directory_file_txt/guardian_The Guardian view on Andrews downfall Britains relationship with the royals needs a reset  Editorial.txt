Title: The Guardian view on Andrew’s downfall: Britain’s relationship with the royals needs a reset | Editorial

Summary: <p>The former prince’s retirement from public life is welcome. Problems around royal secrecy and entitlement remain to be tackled</p><p>Prince Andrew is no more. Henceforth the king’s younger brother will be known as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/oct/31/what-does-it-mean-to-be-plain-old-andrew-mountbatten-windsor">Andrew Mountbatten Windsor</a>. With the Thursday night announcement, and the news that Mr Mountbatten Windsor will quit his 30-room home in Windsor, the monarch hopes to draw a line under the shame of the former prince’s friendship with the dead sex offender&nbsp;Jeffrey Epstein, and alleged sexual assault of Virginia Giuffre when she was 17, which he has always denied.</p><p>These “censures” – as Buckingham Palace termed them – were made necessary by Mr Mountbatten Windsor’s poor judgment and deceit, including the lie that he had broken off contact with Epstein in 2010. But&nbsp;the real damage was done by his grotesquely entitled behaviour and appalling choice of friends. It should not have taken the painful details in Ms&nbsp;Giuffre’s posthumous memoir, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/15/prince-andrew-virginia-giuffre-abuse-epstein-maxwell">an extract of which&nbsp;was published in the Guardian</a>, to make it obvious that the shelter this arrogant man enjoyed had&nbsp;to be removed.</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?
