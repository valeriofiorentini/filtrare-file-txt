Title: Scientists just solved the mystery of perfect spaghetti

Summary: Scientists found that gluten is key to spaghetti’s strength, acting like a microscopic safety net that prevents disintegration. Advanced imaging revealed how gluten-free pasta collapses more easily unless cooked perfectly. Salt, too, plays a structural role beyond flavor. The findings could help improve gluten-free products for better cooking performance and texture.
