Title: Wall Street Week | Larry Summers on the Fed, Argentina Elections, Hinton on AI, Trump’s H-1B Fee

Summary: This week, Former US Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers agrees with Federal Reserve Chair Powell’s reluctance to lock in a December rate cut. And, with new congressional momentum and a victory in midterm elections, Argentina’s President Javier Milei gets the electorate’s buy-in to continue economic reforms that have had mixed results. Plus, Geoffrey Hinton, the “Godfather of AI,” warns that the race to build smarter machines is outpacing efforts to control them, and that humanity must act before it’s too late. Later, will President Trump’s $100,000 H-1B visa fee actually solve the issues of misuse and poor pay, or will it starve the US of global talent? (Source: Bloomberg)
