Title: Life expectancy gains have slowed sharply, study finds

Summary: Researchers found that life expectancy growth in wealthy nations has dramatically slowed since 1939. Once driven by major reductions in child mortality, longevity gains are now limited by slower progress in older-age survival. The study suggests no generation since 1939 will live to 100 on average, reshaping how societies must plan for aging and pensions.
