Title: Scientists reverse Alzheimer’s in mice with groundbreaking nanotech

Summary: Researchers used supramolecular nanoparticles to repair the brain’s vascular system and reverse Alzheimer’s in mice. Instead of carrying drugs, the nanoparticles themselves triggered natural clearance of amyloid-β proteins. This restored blood-brain barrier function and reversed memory loss. The results point to a revolutionary new path for treating neurodegenerative diseases.
