Title: The young local talent breathing new life into the Isle of Skye’s food scene

Summary: <p>A new generation of chefs and distillers are showcasing the Hebridean island’s outstanding produce and creating jobs for fellow islanders</p><p>With its dramatic, rugged mountain skyline, winding roads and ever-changing weather, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/isle-of-skye">Isle of Skye</a> has long appealed to lovers of the wild. Over the last decade, however, the largest island in the Inner Hebrides has been drawing visitors for other reasons – its dynamic food and drink scene.

My grandpa was a lobster fisherman and we’re enjoying shellfish from the same stretch of water, with the same respect for ingredients.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2025/oct/29/isle-of-skye-scotland-young-chef-food-restaurant-whisky-scene">Continue reading...</a>
