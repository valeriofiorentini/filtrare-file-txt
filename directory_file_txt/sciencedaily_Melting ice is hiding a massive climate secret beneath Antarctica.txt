Title: Melting ice is hiding a massive climate secret beneath Antarctica

Summary: The Southern Ocean absorbs nearly half of all ocean-stored human CO2, but its future role is uncertain. Despite models predicting a decline, researchers found that freshening surface waters are currently keeping deep CO2 trapped below. This stratification effect may be only temporary, as intensifying winds bring deep, carbon-rich water closer to the surface. If mixing increases, the Southern Ocean could begin releasing more CO2 than it absorbs.
