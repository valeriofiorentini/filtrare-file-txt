Penman’s skill lies in his total disregard for tired cliches and tropes of music criticism, while perfectly combining the highbrow and the lowbrow – a digression on Les Dawson shows why he might just be our greatest writer on music.</p><p>Cursed Daughters by Oyinkan Braithwaite is published by Atlantic (£18.99).
