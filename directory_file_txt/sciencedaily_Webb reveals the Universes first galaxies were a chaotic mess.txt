Title: Webb reveals the Universe’s first galaxies were a chaotic mess

Summary: JWST observations show that early galaxies were chaotic, gas-filled systems rather than stable disks. Researchers from Cambridge studied over 250 galaxies and found most were turbulent, still forming stars and merging rapidly. These findings challenge earlier views of early galactic order and bridge the gap between the universe’s early chaos and the calmer “cosmic noon” era of peak star formation.
