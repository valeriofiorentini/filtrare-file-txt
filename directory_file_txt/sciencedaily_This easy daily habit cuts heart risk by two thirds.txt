Title: This easy daily habit cuts heart risk by two thirds

Summary: New research reveals that walking in longer, uninterrupted bouts of 10–15 minutes significantly lowers cardiovascular disease risk—by up to two-thirds compared to shorter strolls. Scientists from the University of Sydney and Universidad Europea found that even people who walk less than 8,000 steps daily can see major heart health benefits simply by changing how they walk. Those who took their steps in one or two continuous sessions had lower rates of heart attacks, strokes, and death.
