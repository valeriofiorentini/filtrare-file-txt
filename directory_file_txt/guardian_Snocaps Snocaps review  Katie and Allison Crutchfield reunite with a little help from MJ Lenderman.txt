Title: Snocaps: Snocaps review – Katie and Allison Crutchfield reunite with a little help from MJ Lenderman

Summary: <p><strong>(Anti)<br /></strong>Waxahatchee and her twin sister are joined by Lenderman and Brad Cook for an album of headstrong, tender Americana about chasing integrity and conviction</p><p>Snocaps sound exactly like the sum of their parts. A new band for fans of headstrong, tender Americana, Alabama twins Katie and Allison Crutchfield (of Waxahatchee and Swearin’ respectively) are in a new band together for the first time since scrappy, beloved PS Eliot retired in 2011. Backed by indie guitar star MJ Lenderman and storied alt-rock producer Brad Cook, Snocaps is a family record in more ways than one: the four have a tangled history of making music together, giving this one-off collection the lived-in feel of a band five albums deep.</p><p>With no need for introductions, Snocaps starts with an exercise in trust. We’re in the car, Allison’s at the wheel, and she is daring the rest of the band to close their eyes: “I got a pedal on the floor or I’m slammin’ on the brakes,” she quips, setting the pace for an album about chasing integrity and conviction, told through airborne melodies and unpretentious, freewheeling guitar.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/oct/31/snocaps-review-katie-allison-crutchfield-mj-lenderman-waxahatchee-brad-cook">Continue reading...</a>
