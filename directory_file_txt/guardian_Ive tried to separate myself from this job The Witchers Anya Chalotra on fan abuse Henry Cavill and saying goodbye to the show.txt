Title: ‘I’ve tried to separate myself from this job’: The Witcher’s Anya Chalotra on fan abuse, Henry Cavill and saying goodbye to the show

Summary: <p>After seven years in Netflix’s fantasy epic, the actor has cast her final spell. She talks about the genre’s toxic fans, welcoming new boy Liam Hemsworth to the cast – and what sorcery really sounds like</p><p>It is a bittersweet day for Anya Chalotra. On the one hand, The&nbsp;Witcher, the fantasy epic in&nbsp;which she has played super-sorcerer Yennefer of Vengerberg since 2018, is about to return for a fourth series. All the hard work she and hundreds of others have done can finally be seen by millions of fans worldwide. The cast and crew wrap party is due to take place a few hours after we speak. It’s an exciting time for the actor. But on the other hand: “I wrapped The Witcher for good yesterday,” Chalotra says. “So forgive me if I can’t string a sentence together. It’s all very odd … I&nbsp;cried a lot.”</p><p>Refreshingly for a big-budget fantasy show, The Witcher will bow out with its story complete, rather than at some dissatisfying midpoint due to an unceremonious cancellation. And though viewers will be seeing a&nbsp;final season of monsters, magic, mages, swords, skulduggery and swearing next year, the final two seasons were filmed back to back, meaning after the evening’s shindig, that’s that. The job that has taken over&nbsp;Chalotra’s life for so long, and the&nbsp;people who go with it (besides one&nbsp;high-profile absence, which we’ll touch on later), is finally over.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/oct/31/anya-chalotra-witcher-interview-netflix-yennefer">Continue reading...</a>
