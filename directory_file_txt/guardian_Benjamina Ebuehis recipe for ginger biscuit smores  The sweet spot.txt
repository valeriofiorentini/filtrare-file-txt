Title: Benjamina Ebuehi’s recipe for ginger biscuit s’mores | The sweet spot

Summary: <p>Add an international flavour to Bonfire Night with these gooey American campfire favourites that also work well under a hot grill</p><p>What’s Bonfire Night without some toasty, gooey marshmallows? And it’s only right to have them in a s’more, the American classic that’s also now part of the festivities over on this side of the pond. Digestive biscuits are typically the go-to, but I like to add extra flavour, depth and texture by using ginger oaty biscuits instead. These are quick to put together and don’t require any chilling. Ideally, the s’mores would be made over a real fire, but a blowtorch or hot grill will do the job, too.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/oct/31/ginger-biscuit-smores-recipe-benjamina-ebuehi">Continue reading...</a>
