Title: Gum disease may quietly damage the brain, scientists warn

Summary: People with gum disease may have higher levels of brain white matter damage, a new study finds. Researchers observed that participants with gum disease had significantly more white matter hyperintensities, even after accounting for other risk factors. The findings hint that chronic oral inflammation could subtly impact the brain, especially in older adults. More research is needed, but keeping gums healthy might protect the mind too.
