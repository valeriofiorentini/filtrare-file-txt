Title: Girlbands Forever: this shocking history of 90s female pop is packed with gossip, scandal – and bangers

Summary: <p>Strap in for a nostalgia-stuffed jaunt through musical classics, featuring honest interviews with stars – the details of which make the record industry look appalling </p><p>Girlbands, then. Shimmering icons of empowerment or Pygmalion projects for middle-aged A&amp;R men? Here’s a radical idea – they’re both. Two become one, baby.
