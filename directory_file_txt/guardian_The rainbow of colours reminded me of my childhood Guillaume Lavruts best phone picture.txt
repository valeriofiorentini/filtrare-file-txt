Title: ‘The rainbow of colours reminded me of my childhood’: Guillaume Lavrut’s best phone picture

Summary: <p>On holiday in his home town of Aurillac, the photographer was drawn to a pretty puddle of reflected umbrellas</p><p>Guillaume Lavrut was visiting the small French town of Aurillac with his wife and three children when he took this photo. The family were looking for souvenirs together and exploring the streets when they happened on a canopy of umbrellas. Aurillac is home to one of the world’s oldest umbrella factories and is regarded by many as the umbrella capital of Europe. For Lavrut, however, a&nbsp;visit to Aurillac is about returning home.</p><p>“My family are from there, so we go every summer. It’s so difficult to reach that we need at least a day to get there, but it’s worth it,” Lavrut says.
