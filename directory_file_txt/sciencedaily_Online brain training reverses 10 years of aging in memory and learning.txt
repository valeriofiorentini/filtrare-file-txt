Title: Online brain training reverses 10 years of aging in memory and learning

Summary: A new McGill-led study reveals that digital brain exercises can rejuvenate aging brain systems responsible for learning and memory.

Scans confirmed measurable biochemical changes, offering a hopeful new approach for dementia prevention.
