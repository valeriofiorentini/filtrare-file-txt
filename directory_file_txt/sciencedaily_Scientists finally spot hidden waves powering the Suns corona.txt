Title: Scientists finally spot hidden waves powering the Sun’s corona

Summary: Researchers have directly observed torsional Alfvén waves twisting through the Sun’s corona — magnetic waves first predicted over 80 years ago. Captured using the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope, these motions could explain why the corona is millions of degrees hotter than the Sun’s surface. The finding helps validate decades of solar physics theories and opens new paths to studying solar energy transfer.
