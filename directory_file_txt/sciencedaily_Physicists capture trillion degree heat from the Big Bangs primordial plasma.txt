Title: Physicists capture trillion degree heat from the Big Bang’s primordial plasma

Summary: Rice University researchers have captured the temperature profile of quark-gluon plasma, the ultra-hot state of matter from the dawn of the universe. By analyzing rare electron-positron emissions from atomic collisions, they determined precise temperatures at different phases of the plasma’s evolution. The results not only confirm theoretical predictions but also refine the “QCD phase diagram,” which maps matter’s behavior under extreme conditions.
