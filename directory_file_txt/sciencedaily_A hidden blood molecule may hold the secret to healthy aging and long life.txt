Title: A hidden blood molecule may hold the secret to healthy aging and long life

Summary: Scientists discovered that a blood molecule called CtBP2 may play a major role in how we age. It helps regulate metabolism and appears to link aging across the entire body. Lower levels are tied to poor health and faster aging, while higher levels are found in longer-living people. The finding could lead to simple blood tests that reveal how healthy or “young” your body really is.
