Title: Scientists just shattered a major exercise myth

Summary: New research from Australia overturns the old idea that exercise “uses up” heartbeats. It shows that fitter people actually use fewer total heartbeats each day thanks to their lower resting heart rates, even when accounting for workouts. Athletes’ hearts beat around 10% less daily, saving over 11,000 beats per day compared to sedentary people. This efficiency not only signals cardiovascular fitness but also translates to longer life expectancy and lower disease risk.
