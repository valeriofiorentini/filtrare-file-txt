Title: Earth’s “boring billion” set the stage for complex life

Summary: Scientists have traced the origins of complex life to the breakup of the supercontinent Nuna 1.5 billion years ago. This tectonic shift reduced volcanic carbon emissions, expanded shallow seas, and boosted oxygen availability. Far from a stagnant era, Earth’s “Boring Billion” was a time of crucial transformation that made the planet more habitable. The study links deep-Earth movements directly to the rise of eukaryotic life.
