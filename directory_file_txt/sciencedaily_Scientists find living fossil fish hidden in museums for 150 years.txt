Title: Scientists find “living fossil” fish hidden in museums for 150 years

Summary: Researchers have uncovered dozens of long-misidentified coelacanth fossils in British museums, some overlooked for more than a century. The study reveals that these ancient “living fossils” thrived in tropical seas during the Triassic Period, around 200 million years ago. By re-examining mislabeled bones and using X-ray scans, scientists discovered a once-flourishing community of coelacanths that hunted smaller marine reptiles.
