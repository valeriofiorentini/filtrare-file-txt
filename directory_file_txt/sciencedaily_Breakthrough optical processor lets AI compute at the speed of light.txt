Title: Breakthrough optical processor lets AI compute at the speed of light

Summary: Researchers at Tsinghua University developed the Optical Feature Extraction Engine (OFE2), an optical engine that processes data at 12.5 GHz using light rather than electricity. Its integrated diffraction and data preparation modules enable unprecedented speed and efficiency for AI tasks. Demonstrations in imaging and trading showed improved accuracy, lower latency, and reduced power demand. This innovation pushes optical computing toward real-world, high-performance AI.
