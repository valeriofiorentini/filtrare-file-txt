Title: Twin black hole collisions put Einstein’s general relativity to its most extreme test

Summary: Two recently observed black hole mergers, occurring just weeks apart in late 2024, have opened an extraordinary new window into the universe’s most extreme events. These collisions not only revealed exotic spins and possible second-generation black holes but also provided unprecedented tests of Einstein’s general relativity. The precision of these detections allowed scientists to confirm theoretical predictions with unmatched accuracy, while also probing the possible existence of ultralight bosons—mysterious particles that could draw energy from black holes.
