Title: Scientists turn “junk DNA” into a powerful weapon against cancer

Summary: King’s College London researchers discovered that parts of our DNA once thought to be “junk” can actually help destroy cancer cells. In some blood cancers, damaged genes trigger chaos in these DNA segments, leaving cancer cells vulnerable. When scientists used existing drugs to block the cells’ repair systems, the cells collapsed. This finding could open the door to new treatments for hard-to-treat cancers.
