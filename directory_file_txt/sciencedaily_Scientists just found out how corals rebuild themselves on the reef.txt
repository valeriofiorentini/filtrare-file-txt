Title: Scientists just found out how corals rebuild themselves on the reef

Summary: Researchers at QUT uncovered how corals reattach to reefs through a three-phase process involving tissue transformation, anchoring, and skeleton formation. Differences among species reveal why some corals grow and attach faster than others. Intriguingly, corals even digest their own tissue to heal and prepare for attachment. This insight could make coral restoration projects more precise and successful.
