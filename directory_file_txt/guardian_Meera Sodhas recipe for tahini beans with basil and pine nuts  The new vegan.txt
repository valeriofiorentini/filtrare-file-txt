Title: Meera Sodha’s recipe for tahini beans with basil and pine nuts | The new vegan

Summary: <p>Store-cupboard staples magically transform themselves into a warming autumnal meal</p><p>I’ve been decluttering lately: throwing away or organising old cards, letters and photos, placing them in zipped folders and zapping them with labels made on my beloved Dymo. It’s given me such a great sense of freedom and clarity that I was thinking: I should do the same for my recipes. This one, for example, I would file under “magic”, because it comes together (mostly) from the store-cupboard, both in that easy way in which you throw things into a pot until they alchemise, but also because tahini and beans, together with a lemon, can, magically, become the most soothing antidote to cold weather.</p><p>Join Meera Sodha at a special <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-live-events/2025/sep/24/an-evening-of-guardian-culture-with-tim-dowling-stuart-heritage-and-meera-sodha">event</a> celebrating the best of Guardian culture on Wednesday 26 November, hosted by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/03/comedian-nish-kumar-looks-back">Nish Kumar</a> and alongside writers <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/stuart-heritage">Stuart Heritage</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/timdowling">Tim Dowling</a>, with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/georgina-lawton">Georgina Lawton</a> hosting <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/you-be-the-judge">You be the judge</a> live.
